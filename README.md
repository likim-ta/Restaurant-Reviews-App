## Project Overview 
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I have converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, the project has been improved in the following three areas:
* Responsive Design,
* Accessibility and
* Offline Availability


## Instructions

1. To run the application, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
